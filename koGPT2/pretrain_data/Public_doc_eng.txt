Public health doctors and military doctors have been inserted into the medical field where specialty doctors have left in opposition to the government's expansion of medical schools. It is the government's last ditch effort to maintain the functioning of the third-tier tertiary general hospital, but the second-tier public-private hospitals in the Busan area are still able to accommodate patients.

　According to the medical community on the 11th, a total of nine public health doctors, including four specialists and five general practitioners, were urgently deployed to Pusan National University Hospital. They will receive two days of training and start work on the 13th. The Ministry of Health and Welfare will dispatch a total of 158 people, including 20 military doctors and 138 public health doctors, to 20 medical institutions nationwide, including Pusan National University Hospital, for four weeks from this day to provide manpower support. Other hospitals in Busan are expected to be staffed with public health personnel later. The Welfare Ministry hopes that the inclusion of public health will minimize the burnout of on-site medical staff at training hospitals and ensure the smooth operation of the emergency medical care system centered on severe and emergency patients.

　The Korean Medical Association criticized the situation, saying, "It is more important to fill the gap in training hospitals that will not be resolved than the health of the residents and soldiers in the affected areas," and "The idea that general practitioners who have not completed internships after graduating from medical school can do the work of third- and fourth-year specialists who specialize in their field is born out of ignorance." "The current situation has arisen because the government said it would increase the number of doctors to revive community medicine, but it is incongruous that the government has withdrawn hundreds of military doctors and public affairs doctors who are engaged in community medicine due to the crisis," he said.

　As part of the emergency medical care system, patients with less severe illnesses are being transferred from tertiary general hospitals to secondary general hospitals, but the secondary public and private hospitals in the Busan area are still able to accommodate patients. Busan Medical Center has had 10 out of 16 doctors leave the site since last month, but the hospital is able to provide treatment without much difficulty due to its high proportion of specialists, and the bed utilization rate has not changed. The Southeast Regional Institute of Nuclear Medicine has also lost three to four interns since last month, but specialists are taking turns taking over the duties and the bed utilization rate is similar to normal, with 80 to 90 percent.

　Private general hospitals have seen a slight increase in the number of patients and bed utilization rates compared to normal. An official at a private general hospital in Busan said, "The number of patients has increased slightly since last week, with bed utilization rates ranging from 70 percent to 80 percent." "Outpatients and emergency patients have also increased to a similar level, and we are still able to accommodate them," he said. "Compared to last month, the total number of patients has increased by about half, which is what the medical staff can handle," said an official at another private general hospital.

　The Welfare Ministry is also trying to appease doctors. The ministry is in the process of taking administrative action against doctors who have abandoned their workplaces, and will actively punish those who return to the field before the end of the process. The ministry also plans to open a protection and reporting center for doctors from Dec. 12 to protect doctors who are working in the medical field or want to return to work. As of 11 a.m. on the 8th of this month, the number of residents who have left their workplaces in 100 major training hospitals nationwide was 11,994, or 92.9% of the total.
